<h2>Background and Explanation to project 13a</h2>

The problem 13a comes from CodeWars.  I chose only to answer 2 questions, and chose the Code Wars questions as they appeared more straightforward than those from other sites.  For project 13a, the question I responded to is seen in the following image from CodeWars <img src="question13a.png">

The javascript code for project 13a works basically by using a function called generateNumbers() to create an array called numbers. It iterates through numbers from 1 to 1000 using a for loop. For each number, it checks if it's divisible by 3 or 5 using the % (modulo) operator. If the number is divisible by 3 or 5, it adds that number to the numbers array using numbers.push(i).
Finally, it returns the numbers array containing all numbers meeting the conditions.
